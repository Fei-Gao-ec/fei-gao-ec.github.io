        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Had a surprise meeting with Jensen Hansen at Bunkyo-Gakki on December 10, 2025. Jensen Hansen is not only a renowned cellist but also a great cello educator and author of "Cello Mind." He is one of my biggest cello idols, and I was thrilled to meet him in person and have this opportunity to connect with such an inspiring musician.</p>
